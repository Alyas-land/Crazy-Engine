# ðŸŽ® Crazy DirectX Engine
Crazy DirectX Engine is a simple and lightweight 3D game engine currently in its early development phase. The goal of this project is to build a custom rendering engine using DirectX 12, focusing on performance, modularity, and scalability.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
This engine is being developed using modern game development principles with a modular architecture to ensure flexibility and future expansion.

C++ - The core programming language, chosen for its efficiency and control over hardware.

DirectX 12 - A low-level graphics API for high-performance rendering.

Windows API - Used for window creation and input handling.

DirectXTK12 - A collection of helper utilities for working with DirectX 12 (e.g., texture loading, sprite rendering).

ðŸ“Œ Features (Planned & Implemented)
Basic rendering pipeline (currently in progress).

Swap chain management for smooth frame presentation.

Basic windowing system using Win32 API.

Texture loading support via WICTextureLoader from DirectXTK12.

Modular structure for rendering, input, and scene management.

Future goals: Camera system, lighting, physics integration, and shader support.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to create a lightweight yet efficient 3D engine, which can serve as a foundation for further development in game programming and graphics rendering. The initial focus is on building a basic graphics engine with a strong modular design, allowing developers to extend its functionality easily.

In the long run, this engine could evolve into a custom game engine with advanced rendering techniques such as real-time lighting, shadows, and post-processing effects.
